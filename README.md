fabric-loader-4k
===========

Have you ever wanted to mod Minecraft 4k? No, I'm not talking about 4k the resolution. I'm talking about [Minecraft 4k](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Minecraft_4k), Minecraft in 4 kilobytes.

Why, you ask? Why not!

This is a fork of fabric-loader that adds support for launching Minecraft 4k.

### Original Readme
